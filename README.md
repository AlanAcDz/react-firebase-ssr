# Getting Started with React SSR

This repo contains the sample project for the blog post ["Improve your siteâ€™s SEO and Google ranking with React SSR"](https://alantheace.medium.com/improve-your-sites-seo-and-google-ranking-with-react-ssr-66d02eae54cb).

Also available in spanish [here](https://devaces.com.mx/blog/post/je4zdCDKhJHwAPcEAx8i).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To run this project you need to run `npm install` in both the root and functions folder. Also, make sure you setup your own Firebase project in the *.firebaserc* and *cloudbuild.yaml* files.
